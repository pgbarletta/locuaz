# HADDOCK rescoring scripts             #

Topology and converted pdb with missing
atoms added will be generated for each
pdb analysed.

All PDB files should contain both chainID
and segidID. The pdb_chain-segid script can do that for 
you provided either the chainID or the segid are present

Edit the filelist.list to define the pdb
files to be analysed e.g.  

   ll *.pdb | awk '{print "\"""/home/abonvin/capri12/target28/analysis/rescoring/"$8"\""}' >filelist.list

Edit the scoring.inp CNS input file to
 - define the chain IDs
 - define the protonation state of HISTIDINES

Edit the run_scoring.csh to define the
correct paths to CNS and HADDOCK2.1

After running run_scoring, PDB files ending with _conv.pdb will be generated.

The scores can then be extracted using:

  make-files.csh *_conv.pdb

This will create a file.nam and file.list files, ranked based on the HADDOCK score. The HADDOCK score will be given in the file.list file.
