class MutationCreator(Mapping):
    """
    MutationCreator creates mutations by:
        * choosing 1 or more positions after discarding the excluded ones and
          optionally discarding those that are not interfacing with the target.
        * optionally splits amino acids into user-defined bins. Then chooses the
          bin of the current residue ('within') or any of the other ones ('exclude').
        * within the potential amino acids, it chooses one of them following a
          uniform distribution ('uniform'), Reis&Barletta distribution ('ReisBarletta')
          or a custom user-defined probability ('custom')

    For each position, the chosen amino acid will be discarded from future
    consideration. This also applies to bins. If all bins were discarded and
    more mutations were asked for, the bins are reset but not the potential
    amino acids.

    Parameters
    ----------
    top_branches : Dict[str, Branch]
        top branches from the last epoch
    branches : int
        number of branches to attempt to create.
    creation_config : Dict[str, Any]
        creation section from the input config file
    excluded_sites : Set[int]
        resSeqs of the excluded positions, probably because they've recently
        been mutated
    amber_numbering : bool
        when using Tleap, the resSeq numbering scheme is continuous as opposed
        to the strided scheme from GROMACs where each chain begins with resSeq 1
