Tutorial: optimizing an antibody against a ligand
===================================================

Sometimes our starting docked structure is not very good, and the binder may loose
the target after some nanoseconds. This is more frequent when simulating docked
ligands.

In this tutorial we will use what we learn in previous tutorials, plus some other
new tricks, to optimize a nanobody against a tirosol molecule, like the one on
Figure 1.

``allowed_nonstandard_residues``

remember that for scoring, all target chains are renamed A, and all the ones from the binder are renamed B.
write about the sanitization the protocol does with the splitted frames. All scorers but gmxmmpbsa use this PDBs.


``memory_positions`` and ``failed_memory_positions``:
empty memory slots on input user memory are allowed.
This allows the user to control for how many epochs will the non-empty memory be recalled.
Place them after the desired positions:

``memory_positions: [[2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8], [], [], [] ]``

Add chainID with parmed::

        parm pre_nb.prmtop
        addPDB start.pdb
        outparm nb.prmtop
        go

You can also use cpptraj to add the chainIDs to the ``.rst7`` and ``.pdb`` files::

    parm nb.prmtop
    trajin nb.rst7
    trajout nb.pdb
